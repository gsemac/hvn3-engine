# hvn3-engine
A WIP 2D game engine

This is a 2D game engine project based around the [Allegro library](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5) that I've been working on for the past while.

The engine is currently in a fairly *usuable* state, but far from complete. I'm constantly renaming functions and classes, reorganizing hierarchies and namespaces, and refactoring large sections of code, and there's no thorough documentation aside from the comments in a few of the header files. The project should be considered as being in an **alpha** state for the time being.

I've learned a fair bit through working on this project, so some parts of the code are better written than others, and some of the very old code might not be compliant with mainstream guidelines. Polishing everything out, adding new features, and writing better implementations for existing features is an ongoing process.
